# Mushroom Classification Project

This project explores a machine learning model to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous. The dataset used for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains various features of mushrooms, which will be processed and used for classification.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to use different machine learning algorithms to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its features. Several algorithms will be tested, including:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains various attributes of mushrooms, such as:

- Cap shape
- Cap surface
- Cap color
- Bruising
- Odor
- Gill size
- Stalk shape, and others

The target variable is the **class** (whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running Python code and visualizing results.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for Python.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for creating plots and charts.
